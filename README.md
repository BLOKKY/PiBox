**NOTICE** This is my very old, old project that ended up becoming pointless. I was really young back then, and I really didn't know what I was doing.
There are also some pieces of code(especially resisitive touchscreen calibration code, which was made for me by someone else) which were copied somewhere from the internet. And I don't even know what that font is, where it came from, and license of it.

I honestly don't know if it is safe to keep this repository open, but I am leaving it on here for historical purposes.
